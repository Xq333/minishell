# minishell Project README

## Overview

The **minishell** project is an enlightening journey in my 42 school curriculum. This project challenged me to create a simplified Unix shell, enabling users to interact with the operating system through a command-line interface.

## What I Learned

Through the **minishell** project, I gained a wealth of knowledge and skills, including:

1. **Command Parsing:** I learned how to parse and interpret command lines entered by users, making sense of commands, options, and arguments.

2. **Built-in Commands:** I implemented a range of built-in shell commands, such as `cd` for changing directories, `echo` for console output, and `env` for displaying environment variables.

3. **Process Management:** The project provided a hands-on experience in executing external programs or binaries from the shell, managing processes using system calls like `execve`.

4. **Piping and Redirection:** I mastered the art of connecting commands with pipes (`|`) and redirecting input and output using file redirection (`>`, `<`).

5. **Signal Handling:** I became proficient in handling signals, ensuring the graceful interruption of processes with Ctrl+C, for example.

6. **Environment Variables:** Managing and manipulating environment variables, including setting the `PATH` variable for command execution.

## Project Structure

The **minishell** project typically involves creating a command-line interface, handling command parsing, implementing built-in commands, and managing processes. It's a practical exercise in systems programming and shell design.

## Usage

The skills I acquired through the **minishell** project are applicable to various aspects of systems programming, process management, and command-line interfaces. This project equips me with the ability to create and understand shell environments.

## Credits

This project was completed as part of my 42 school curriculum.
